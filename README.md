# CCD Tool
This is a "stripped down" version of a simple tool created for my former employee, based off of design and functional requirements provided by the business stakeholders.

The purpose of the tool is to consolidate intranet content into a checklist format so that Customer Service Representatvies could provide required disclosure information during particular transactions with customers.

The tool was originally designed to fit in a fixed-size window in an Internet Explorer-only environment.

This is being posted with permission under the guidlelines that any company specific information was removed
